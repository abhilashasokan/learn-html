  Sputnik I, triggering 'US Government to create the ARPA
  (Advanced Research Projects Agency) to regain the
  technological lead in the arms race and help protect the US
  against a space-based nuclear attack. This resulted

  network and the internet was born. In 1990, the ARPANET
  was retired and transferred to the National Science
  Foundation Network (NSFNET). The NSFNET was soon
  connected to the Computer Science Network (CSNET), which
  linked Universities around North America, and then to the
  European Network (EUnet) which connected research facilities
  in Europe. The online world changed into its current
  recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim
  Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW). The use
  of the Internet increased exponentially after 1990 causing
  the US Government to transfer management to independent
