<p nz-typography>
  HTML code is generally typed into notepad. Open notepad
  and type the following.
  <img src="assets/img/web/web2.png" alt="web 2" title="web 2" class="img-block" />
  Each one of those is a tag. There is a starting tag and a closing
  tag. To make a closing tag just add a / to the starting tag.
  Most, but not all tags have a closing tag. Think of tags as
  enclosing a bit of text for the browser to interpret. The browser
  will interpret everything between <b><i>&lt;html&gt;</i></b> and <b><i>&lt;/html&gt;</i></b> as an
  HTML document. Different tags are interpreted different ways
  by the browser.
  Please note that it's important that you nest tags properly as
  explained earlier. Once you type in an opening or starting tag
  please type in the closing tag also. You should not wait till
  the end of the document to insert the corresponding closing
  tags.
  Every HTML document needs a pair of head tags
</p>
<img src="assets/img/web/web3.png" alt="web 3" title="web 3" class="img-block" />

<p nz-typography>
  Let's focus only on head tags and the title tags.
</p>
<img src="assets/img/web/web4.png" alt="web 4" title="web 4" class="img-block" />
<p nz-typography>
  And the bulk of the page is going to be within the body tags
  which is given below. The general structure of an HTML code
  also can be summarized with the following.
  <img src="assets/img/web/web5.png" alt="web 5" title="web 5" class="img-block" />
  Give your document a title and type in something in the body.
  <img src="assets/img/web/web6.png" alt="web 6" title="web 6" class="img-block" />

</p>
<h3>Saving an HTML document.</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  The HTML code written should be saved. But when you save
  it,save it as an html document, not as a text document. Save
  it as <b>lesson1.html</b> in a new folder. Otherwise the document will be saved a .txt file which is the default
  format of a notepad
  file. The saved file will have the icon of a web browser, as
  follows;
  <img src="assets/img/web/web7.png" alt="web 7" title="web 7" class="img-block" />
  Click on the icon and the output will appear as follows.
  <img src="assets/img/web/web8.png" alt="web 8" title="web 8" class="img-block" />
</p>

<h3> Changing background colours</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  If you noticed, the background of the html file is white since
  we have not mentioned any colours as background.
  <img src="assets/img/web/web9.png" alt="web 9" title="web 9" class="img-block" />
  You will notice that the background changes from white to
  green.
</p>

<h3>Inserting images as background</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  Instead of having a background that is plain, we can add a
  picture to your background.
  You can specify a background image instead. <b>(Note, the image
    should be in the same folder as your HTML file. Or else
    copy the path of the file).</b>
  <img src="assets/img/web/web10.png" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />

</p>

<h3>Working with Text</h3>
<h4>Whitespace</h4>
<p nz-typography>
  Consider the following code given below, you will realize
  that the spacing between 'Hello' and 'everyone' is quite large.
  In this case HTML will not read more than one spacing so the
  output will be exactly the same as given below.
  <img src="assets/img/web/web11.png" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
  If you need more white spacing you will use & nbsp which
  stands for Non-Breaking Space. If you need more than one
  space you will have to add as many & nbsp as you need.
  <img src="assets/img/web/web12.png" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
  There are number of formatting options that you can use while
  preparing HTML pages. The commonly used features are:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Tag</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Bold</b></td>
      <td>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Underline</b></td>
      <td>&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Italics</b></td>
      <td>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Change font</b></td>
      <td>font face</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Changing font size</b></td>
      <td>font size</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p nz-typography>
  What we are telling the browser is: at the <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> start making text bold, and at the <b>&lt;/b&gt;</b>
  stop making text bold. As the first attempt, make 'hello everyone' in our document bold.
</p>
<p nz-typography>
  <code>&lt;b&gt; Hello everyone&lt;/b&gt;</code>
</p>
<p nz-typography>
  Underline that same sentence. <br />
  <code>&lt;u&gt;Hello everyone&lt;/u&gt;</code>
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  Make that same sentence Italics.
  <br />
  <code>&lt;i&gt;Hello everyone&lt;/i&gt; <br /></code>
  We can use tags in combi√±ation if we wish.<br />
  <img src="assets/img/web/web13.png" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
  <img src="assets/img/web/web14.png" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
</p>
<p nz-typography>
  This is an example of nested tags. If you are going to use tag
  pairs in combination make sure that they are nested properly,
  not overlapping.
</p>

<h3>Changing font, font size and colour</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  First add the <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> tags... <br />
  <img src="assets/img/web/web15.png" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
  <img src="assets/img/web/web16.png" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Very small</th>
      <th>Small</th>
      <th>Regular</th>
      <th>Extra medium</th>
      <th>Large</th>
      <th>Extra large</th>
      <th>Largest</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>1</b></td>
      <td><b>2</b></td>
      <td><b>3</b></td>
      <td><b>4</b></td>
      <td><b>5</b></td>
      <td><b>6</b></td>
      <td><b>7</b></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p nz-typography>
  <b>
    First, a <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> tells the browser to do something. An
    attribute goes inside the <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> and tells the browser how
    to do it.
  </b>
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  Second point is about defaults. As you probably know,
  the default value is a value that the browser assumes if you
  have not told it otherwise. A good example is the font size.
  The default font size is 3 (usually).
  Take note that quotation marks are being used. Whenever
  you have an <b>attribute="value", the value should be in
    quotes.</b>
</p>

<h3>Headings</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  Another useful tag is section headings. They come in sizes
  1-6. It should be understood that hl to h6 is from largest to
  smallest.
