    <h4>Elements</h4>
    <p nz-typography>
      <mark>All HTML pages are made up of elements. An element is
        just like a container in which a portion of a page is placed. An
        element consists of two tags namely, an opening tag and a closing tag.
        Whatever is contained inside the element will take on the characteristics of the element. For example, to
        identify
        a heading on a page, the heading matter should be enclosed in a heading element as
        <b><i>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/hl&gt;</i></b>.
        The elements which do not require a closing tag are known as
        empty elements.</mark> In the case of empty elements a closing slash
      is added after the element name. A space is also added between
      the element name and the slash like.
      For example,
      For a line break, the tag will be - <b><i>&lt;br /&gt;</i></b>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Tags</h4>
    <p nz-typography>
      <mark>Tags are commands written in text document (in Note
        Pad). They are not displayed in the Web pages.
        A Tag begins a "less than" sign <b><i>(&lt;)</i></b>, then the element name,
        followed by a â€œgreater than" <b><i>(&gt;)</i></b> sign. Such a tag is called as
        an opening tag. In the case of a closing tag, it includes a
        "back slash" <b><i>(/)</i></b> before the element name. <br /></mark>
      For example:<br />
      Opening tag for the paragraph element will be - <b><i>&lt;p&gt;</i></b> <br />
      Closing tag for the paragraph element will be - <b><i>&lt;/p&gt;</i></b> <br />
    </p>
  </li>

    <h4>Attributes and Values</h4>
    <p nz-typography>
      <mark>Attributes are another important part of HTML. An
        attribute is used to define the characteristics of an element
        and is placed inside the element's opening tag.</mark>
      For example; <br />
      To specify the size of an image or graphics on the Web page,
      the <i>image element</i> is to be used with <i>height</i> and <i>width</i> as
      <br /><code>&lt;img height=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</code><br />
      Here, height and width are attributes. The attributes should
      be followed by their values.
      For example, if the size of the image is 300 x 200 pixels, the
      HTML statement will be
      <br /><code>&lt;img height= &quot;300&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Nesting</h4>
    <p nz-typography><mark>Nesting means arrangement of the elements in such a
        way that there is no overlapping of elements. Properly nested
        elements are contained inside one another,</mark> as in the following.
      <br /><code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> <br />
      Vertically Shown as follows;
      <br />

    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
