<h3 nz-typography>Limitations of SPSS</h3>
Though SPSS has lot of advantages, it is not free from limitations.

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <h3>High Cost: </h3>
    <p>SPSS is considered very expensive compared to many other competitive alternatives. The Current Version SPSS 26
      costs approximately Rs 92,000 per license for a year. PSPP, is a software very similar to SPSS, is free. 'R' a
      highly versatile software which is used for statistical analysis, is also free. Trial version of SPSS for 14 days
      is available from the official website. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Newer Versions: </h3>
    <p>SPSS also introduces newer versions frequently like any other software. But there are very few significant
      changes in the new versions in comparison to the previous ones. This makes buying new versions not cost effective.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Important tools not part of the base version: </h3>
    <p> SPSS Base v26 is the basic version of the software. This version is bought by most of the users. But many useful
      procedures are not included in the base package. In order to have access for the advanced useful tools, the user
      will have to purchase the relevant add- on's, which are expensive.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Graphs are of mediocre quality: </h3>
    <p>Graphs are the most common method to visually illustrate relationships in the data. SPSS can be used to prepare
      Graphs also. In comparison to other software, the default graphics that are generated out of SPSS are just
      ordinary. Graphs generated out of other software fare better. The output generated from SPSS could be improved
      with chart editing.
