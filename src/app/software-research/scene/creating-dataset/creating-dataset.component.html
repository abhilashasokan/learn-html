  A data set can be created in SPSS by the following steps. <br />
  <b>File> New > Data</b>
</p>

<h3 nz-typography>Illustration 2</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  If a user wants to analyze marks of 10 students for 5 subjects, Data from students may be collected based on the
  variables given in the table below.The following details should be entered in the Variable View. Variable Name cannot
  start with a numeral, blank characters (space) not allowed.
  <img src="assets/img/spss/16.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  Since, for analysis of data, only numerals can be used, Value Labels should be entered for categorical data. In the
  example Gender, (Male and Female) and Exam Board (State Board, CBSE, ISC) are categorical data, the categories should
  be defined using value labels. Male=1 and Female =2 or any appropriate coding.
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  in the Variable View, Click on the cell under Value, an icon with three dots will be displayed. Click on the icon, to
  go to the Value Labels Dialogue Box
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  In the Values Labels Dialogue box, Give Value: 1, Label: Male and Click Add. Repeat the procedure for Female Value: 2,
  Label: Female.

</p>

<p nz-typography>
  Do the same procedure for Exam Board 1 for State Board, 2 for CBSE 3 for ISC.

</p>

<p nz-typography>
  The <b>Variables View</b> after defining all variables is shown below.
  <img src="assets/img/spss/19.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  The data for the file has been entered and Data View is displayed in the following image (Fig. 16). Students can enter
  their own data or enter the data as given.
  <img src="assets/img/spss/20.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
  Save the data as DataSetl. File > Save. The file will be saved by SPSS with .sav as extension. This example will be
  used for illustrating various options SPSS hereafter.
</p>

<h3 nz-typography>Inserting cases and variables in SPSS</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  Inserting cases/ variables in SPSS is similar to how data is entered in excel. Go to last row containing
  cases/variables and enter the new case or variable in the next row. But if the user wants to insert a case or a
  variable in between the cases or variables, use the following methods
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  A new case can be inserted in SPSS in multiple ways
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Click Edit > Insert Cases; or
  </li>
  <li>
    Right-click on a row and select Insert Cases from the menu; or
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Insert Cases icon
  </li>
</ol>
<p nz-typography>
  A new variable can also be inserted in multiple ways</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Click Edit > Insert Variables
  </li>
  <li>
    Right-click on a column and select Insert Variables from the menu or
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Insert Variables icon
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 nz-typography> Selecting Cases in SPSS</h3>

<p nz-typography>
  The DataSet that is being used will have hundreds of cases. But the user might need only few of the cases for
  analysis.
  In case when the user might need only a subset of all the data collected for analysis, the Select Cases option can be
  used. For example, of the data file that was created, the researcher might be interested in analysis of only female
  students. To select cases in SPSS, perform the following tasks <br />
  <b>Data> Select cases.</b>
</p>
<p nz-typography>
  As mentioned earlier, if only female candidates need to be included in the analysis, in the <b>Select Cases menu</b>,
  in the
  Select group, use the second condition, <b>If condition is satisfied</b>.
  <img src="assets/img/spss/21.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  After selecting If... a new window would pop out which appears as below(Fig 18).The appropriate variable has to be
  moved to the window using and the necessary condition given. If the data has to selected based on female, the option
  is Gender=2. Kindly recollect that gender was coded as Male=1, and Female=2. Thus on giving the option, Gender=2, only
  female candidates will be selected.
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  Use the number pad given in the window or use the keyboard to enter the condition i.e., (=2).
  <img src="assets/img/spss/22.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  Click Continue and OK to close the respective windows and return to the data view. Upon completing the task the data
  view will appear as below. Kindly note that the cases which were excluded will have a diagonal strike through and the
  included cases will appear without the strike through. SPSS assigns a filter to select the required cases which is
  displayed in the last column.
  <img src="assets/img/spss/23.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
  In this example, kindly note that case numbers 1, 7, 8 and 10 only are selected for the analysis, as the user set
  female cases to be selected as the condition.
</p>

<h3 nz-typography>Listing Cases</h3>
<p nz-typography>
  Listing cases is a very useful function if the user wants a list of variables or cases from the DataSet. The list of
  variables will be displayed in the output viewer and can be exported to a Word Processing software as the user
  desires. By default only the first 100 cases will be displayed.<br />
  <b>Analyze > Reports > Case Summaries</b>
  <img src="assets/img/spss/24.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" class="img-block" />
  The variables that you want to prepare a case summary of, should be moved into the Variables: box using the . In the
  example used, Name and 12th board exam has been considered to prepare case summaries
</p>

<p nz-typography>
  The output view will have the result of the Case Summaries.
